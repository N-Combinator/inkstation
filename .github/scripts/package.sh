# GitHub rejects release assets whose name ends in .app, hence the zip. The
# checksum file lists the zip (what `sha256sum -c --ignore-missing` checks after
# a download) and, as a comment, the .app inside it — every platform's app has
# the same file name, so it cannot be a checkable entry of the merged file.
